function knightMoves(start, end) {
  // shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
  // You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates. Calling your function would therefore look like:
  //knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) // returns [[0,0],[1,2]]
}

function getLegalMoves(start) {
  //return all legal moves from the starting position represented as [x,y]
}
